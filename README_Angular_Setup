To run the Angular application locally, first download Node.js. Use NPM to run:

npm install -g @angular/cli

After Angular is installed, you can use command prompt to create a new Angular project.
Simply run:

ng new fish-tank-project

Then, to work with these files in the command line just set your CD to the project folder:

cd fish-tank-project

Navigate from the base folder to "fish-tank-project\src\app,"
then replace the files there with the app.component files in this repository.

Next, use the command line (be sure to set your cd!) to run:

ng build

Then, 

ng serve

And the application will be running on localhost:4200. You can view it here,
and it will listen to any changes to the source files.
