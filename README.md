# FISh_Tank_Project

Abstract: This project is developed for the Summer 2019 Internship at Fidelity National Information Services (FIS). 
The idea behind it is to aid FIS in improving their exposure to students seeking internships in the financial technologies industry. 
This application is developed in Python, and is able to automatically load a webpage listing the currently available internships 
FIS has open. 

Dependencies: This application is developed on the MacOS system with python 3.7 and uses the splinter library with 
Google Chrome web browser. This also required installing the geckodriver executable file and setting it in your executable PATH. 

For MacOS, use the following command line arguments 'brew install geckodriver' to automatically install the executable to your 
PATH. Note, that this also requires you to have the 'brew' command line application installed as well. 

Prequesites:
- Python 3.5 or greater with splinter library 
- Google Chrome Web Browser
- geckodriver

Usage: In your command line/terminal application, navigate to the local file directory of this application. 
If Python 3 is not set as your default version, call 'python3 main.py' from the command line. Otherwise, use 'python main.py'


The image1, image2, and image3 files need to go in the "assets" folder of your Angular project.
To load the video file, place it in the assets folder as well, and make sure the video's name
is the same as in the HTML tag attribute, or change it.

Modern web browsers only only Angular apps to load local resources from the "assets" folder as assessing other disk 
space is a security risk.
